# Hello and welcome!

## This repository contains a template for a PHP site with basic sign up and log in functionality.

- The site is bare-bones; static HTML and CSS are served to the user while the PHP code performs
server-side functions such as creating and logging users in, creating user sessions, etc.

- **This site has been tested on Debian 11 using nginx 1.18.0, MySQL 8.0.27, and PHP 7.4.**
- It should work on other Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Gentoo, Fedora) but these have not been tested.

### Installation and startup instructions are contained within STARTUP.md.

## Thanks for stopping by, enjoy !
